## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**includeRelatedObjects** | **bool** | If `true`, the response will include additional objects that are related to the requested objects. Related objects are defined as any objects referenced by ID by the results in the `objects` field of the response. These objects are put in the `related_objects` field. Setting this to `true` is helpful when the objects are needed for immediate display to a user. This process only goes one level deep. Objects referenced by the related objects will not be included. For example,  if the `objects` field of the response contains a CatalogItem, its associated CatalogCategory objects, CatalogTax objects, CatalogImage objects and CatalogModifierLists will be returned in the `related_objects` field of the response. If the `objects` field of the response contains a CatalogItemVariation, its parent CatalogItem will be returned in the `related_objects` field of the response.  Default value: `false` | [optional] 
**catalogVersion** | **int** | Requests objects as of a specific version of the catalog. This allows you to retrieve historical versions of objects. The value to retrieve a specific version of an object can be found in the version field of [CatalogObject](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2023-12-13/objects/CatalogObject)s. If not included, results will be from the current version of the catalog. | [optional] 
**includeCategoryPathToRoot** | **bool** | Specifies whether or not to include the `path_to_root` list for each returned category instance. The `path_to_root` list consists of `CategoryPathToRootNode` objects and specifies the path that starts with the immediate parent category of the returned category and ends with its root category. If the returned category is a top-level category, the `path_to_root` list is empty and is not returned in the response payload. | [optional]
