**updatedAt** | **String** | The timestamp of when the payment was last updated, in RFC 3339 format. | [optional] 
**amountMoney** | [**Money**](Money.md) |  | [optional] 
**tipMoney** | [**Money**](Money.md) |  | [optional] 
**totalMoney** | [**Money**](Money.md) |  | [optional] 
**appFeeMoney** | [**Money**](Money.md) |  | [optional] 
**approvedMoney** | [**Money**](Money.md) |  | [optional] 
**processingFee** | [**List<ProcessingFee>**](ProcessingFee.md) | The processing fees and fee adjustments assessed by Square for this payment. | [optional] [default to const []]
**refundedMoney** | [**Money**](Money.md) |  | [optional] 
**status** | **String** | Indicates whether the payment is APPROVED, PENDING, COMPLETED, CANCELED, or FAILED. | [optional] 
**delayDuration** | **String** | The duration of time after the payment's creation when Square automatically applies the `delay_action` to the payment. This automatic `delay_action` applies only to payments that do not reach a terminal state (COMPLETED, CANCELED, or FAILED) before the `delay_duration` time period.  This field is specified as a time duration, in RFC 3339 format.  Notes: This feature is only supported for card payments.  Default:  - Card-present payments: \"PT36H\" (36 hours) from the creation time. - Card-not-present payments: \"P7D\" (7 days) from the creation time. | [optional] 
**delayAction** | **String** | The action to be applied to the payment when the `delay_duration` has elapsed.  Current values include `CANCEL` and `COMPLETE`. | [optional] 
**delayedUntil** | **String** | The read-only timestamp of when the `delay_action` is automatically applied, in RFC 3339 format.  Note that this field is calculated by summing the payment's `delay_duration` and `created_at` fields. The `created_at` field is generated by Square and might not exactly match the time on your local machine. | [optional] 
**sourceType** | **String** | The source type for this payment.  Current values include `CARD`, `BANK_ACCOUNT`, `WALLET`, `BUY_NOW_PAY_LATER`, `SQUARE_ACCOUNT`, `CASH` and `EXTERNAL`. For information about these payment source types, see [Take Payments](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-api/take-payments). | [optional] 
**cardDetails** | [**CardPaymentDetails**](CardPaymentDetails.md) |  | [optional]

**locationId** | **String** | The ID of the location associated with the payment. | [optional]

**referenceId** | **String** | An optional ID that associates the payment with an entity in another system. | [optional] 
**customerId** | **String** | The ID of the customer associated with the payment. If the ID is  not provided in the `CreatePayment` request that was used to create the `Payment`,  Square may use information in the request  (such as the billing and shipping address, email address, and payment source)  to identify a matching customer profile in the Customer Directory.  If found, the profile ID is used. If a profile is not found, the  API attempts to create an  [instant profile](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/customers-api/what-it-does#instant-profiles).  If the API cannot create an  instant profile (either because the seller has disabled it or the  seller's region prevents creating it), this field remains unset. Note that  this process is asynchronous and it may take some time before a  customer ID is added to the payment. | [optional] 
**employeeId** | **String** | __Deprecated__: Use `Payment.team_member_id` instead.  An optional ID of the employee associated with taking the payment. | [optional] 
**teamMemberId** | **String** | An optional ID of the [TeamMember](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2023-12-13/objects/TeamMember) associated with taking the payment. | [optional]
