**pointsAddition** | **int** | The number of additional points to earn each time the promotion is triggered. For example, suppose a purchase qualifies for 5 points from the base loyalty program. If the purchase also qualifies for a `POINTS_ADDITION` promotion incentive with a `points_addition` of 3, the buyer earns a total of 8 points (5 program points + 3 promotion points = 8 points). |
